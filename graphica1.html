        <h2>Importance</h2>
        <p>Regular physical activity is one of the most important things you can do for your health. Being physically active can improve your brain health, help manage weight, reduce the risk of disease, strengthen bones and muscles, and improve your ability to do everyday activities.
            Adults who sit less and do any amount of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity gain some health benefits. Only a few lifestyle choices have as large an impact on your health as physical activity.
            Everyone can experience the health benefits of physical activity – age, abilities, ethnicity, shape, or size do not matter.</p>

        <h2>Nutrition Tips</h2>
        <img src="gr2.jpg" height="300px" width="500px" alt="error">
        <p>1. <b>Variety of Nutrient-Dense Foods:</b><br>
            Include a variety of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats in your diet.
            Different foods provide different essential nutrients, so aim for a diverse range.<br><br>
            2.<b>Portion Control:</b><br>
            Be mindful of portion sizes to avoid overeating.
            Use smaller plates to help with portion control.<br><br>
            3.<b>Hydration:</b><br>
            Drink plenty of water throughout the day.
            Limit sugary drinks and excessive caffeine intake.<br><br>
            4. <b>Whole Grains:</b><br>

            5. <b>Lean Proteins:</b><br>
            Include sources of lean protein in your diet, such as poultry, fish, tofu, legumes, and low-fat dairy.
            Limit red meat consumption and choose lean cuts.<br><br>
            6.<b>Healthy Fats:</b><br>
            Incorporate sources of healthy fats, like avocados, nuts, seeds, and olive oil.
            Limit saturated and trans fats found in processed and fried foods.<br><br>
            7. <b>Fruits and Vegetables:</b><br>
            Aim for a colorful mix of fruits and vegetables, as different colors indicate different nutrients.
            Opt for whole fruits over fruit juices for added fiber.<br><br>
            8.<b>Limit Added Sugars and Salt:</b>Limit Added Sugars and Salt:<br>
            Minimize the intake of foods and beverages high in added sugars.

    <h3>" Fighting diseases"</h3>
    <div class="univ">
        <div class="container">
            <div class="violet">5.<b>Heart Disease:</b><br> 
                Cardiovascular exercise such as running, walking, swimming, biking, and some forms of HIIT require the heart to pump and work hard. This preserves heart function and promotes a healthy weight, which is a leading determinant of the aforementioned conditions.</div>
            <div class="blue">6.<b>Osteopenia and Osteoporosis:</b><br>

                Osteopenia and osteoporosis involve weakness of the bones and thus, muscle to some extent. Although somewhat counterintuitive, regular weight-bearing exercise is the single best way to prevent loss of bone mass.
                </div>
            <div class="green">4.<b> Obesity and Metabolic Syndrome:</b><br>
              Exercise burns energy from carbohydrates and fat, thus, discouraging the storage of energy as fat. Alongside a nutritionally adequate diet, exercise is one of the best ways to avoid metabolic syndrome (a conglomeration of pre-diseased states) and obesity.</div>
            <div class="yellow">3.<b>Depression:</b><br>

                Consistent exercise has been shown to effectively help treat depression. It can also be utilized to proactively prevent it or at least, reduce the severity of the experience.
                </div>
            <div class="orange">1.<b>Asthma:</b><br>

                Similar to osteopenia and osteoporosis mentioned above, it may seem illogical that exercise, an acute lung stressor, can prevent asthma. 
                
                 As with tearing muscles through exercise, acute stress to the lungs allows them to build and repair even better.</div>
            <div class="red">2. <b>Arthritis:</b><br>

                Some people are born with arthritis, and while such a factor is unpreventable, exercise can certainly help manage arthritic symptoms. 
                Opportunely, regular exercise can help prevent it by keeping muscles surrounding joints strong. </div>
